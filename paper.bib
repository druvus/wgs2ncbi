    abstract = "{Genome sequences nowadays play a central role in molecular biology and bioinformatics. These sequences are shared with the scientific community through sequence databases. The sequence repositories of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, comprising GenBank, ENA and DDBJ) are the largest in the world. Preparing an annotated sequence in such a way that it will be accepted by the database is challenging because many validation criteria apply. In our opinion, it is an undesirable situation that researchers who want to submit their sequence need either a lot of experience or help from partners to get the job done. To save valuable time and money, we list a number of recommendations for people who want to submit an annotated genome to a sequence database, as well as for tool developers, who could help to ease the process.}",
