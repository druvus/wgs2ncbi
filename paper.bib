    abstract = "{Genome sequences nowadays play a central role in molecular biology and bioinformatics. These sequences are shared with the scientific community through sequence databases. The sequence repositories of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, comprising GenBank, ENA and DDBJ) are the largest in the world. Preparing an annotated sequence in such a way that it will be accepted by the database is challenging because many validation criteria apply. In our opinion, it is an undesirable situation that researchers who want to submit their sequence need either a lot of experience or help from partners to get the job done. To save valuable time and money, we list a number of recommendations for people who want to submit an annotated genome to a sequence database, as well as for tool developers, who could help to ease the process.}",

@article{GenBank2015,
	Abstract = {GenBank({\textregistered}) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for over 300 000 formally described species. These sequences are obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole-genome shotgun and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and GenBank staff assign accession numbers upon data receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Nucleotide Archive and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP.},
