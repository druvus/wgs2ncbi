**What it does**

This tool is part of the WGS2NCBI pipeline, which prepares the annotated results of whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) for submission to NCBI. In this step of the pipeline, leading and
trailing gaps (stretches of NNNs) are trimmed from the sequences, and the coordinates of
the sequence features are adjusted accordingly.
