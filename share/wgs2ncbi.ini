; Prefix that is used as part of autogenerated identifiers.
prefix=L345_

; Location of the submission template as produced by http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/template.cgi
template=share/template.sbt

; File with additional metadata about the source organism that was sequenced.
info=share/info.ini

; File with corrected product names.
products=share/products.ini

; File with sequence fragments to mask (e.g. adaptors, contaminations, spurious duplications)

; Naming authority for autogenerated identifiers.
authority=gnl|NaturalisBC

[data]
; Sequences are in FASTA format. The datafile contains the entire genome in a single file, whose records can
; be scaffolds, contigs, chromosomes. The names of these sequences must match those in the annotations.
datadir=share/tblfasta
datafile=share/king_cobra_scaffolds_spring_2011-cleaned.fasta

[annotations]
; Annotations are in GFF3 format. The gff3file contains all the annotations in a single file, whose
; contents are exploded into sequence-specific annotations as separate files in gff3dir
gff3dir=share/gff3
gff3file=share/cobra.functional-cleaned.gff

; The preferred source whose annotations to use.
source=maker

[runtime]
; Number of sequences to lump in one file. Must be <= 10,000
chunksize=5000

; Verbosity. Can be 1 (warnings only), 2 (info messages) or 3 (debugging messages)
verbosity=1

; Minimum length of sequences to retain. Must be >= 200
minlength=200

; Number of sequences to write (used for testing). Set to 0 for all sequences.
limit=0

; Minimum length of introns to retain. Must be >= 10. In genes that have smaller introns all CDS features 
; are lumped to create a non-coding pseudogene.
minintron=10

; where to write *.sqn and validation files.
outdir=share/asn1val

; where to write the discrepancy report.
